# AnimeVerse Recommendation System

AnimeVerse is a comprehensive anime recommendation system leveraging big data and machine learning to provide personalized suggestions based on user preferences. This project utilizes various algorithms and techniques to optimize the recommendation process, ensuring a dynamic and tailored user experience.


## Project Overview
As anime grows in popularity worldwide, viewers face challenges in discovering content that matches their unique preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often fail to offer dynamic, personalized suggestions. AnimeVerse aims to bridge this gap by ensuring every recommendation is made with a thorough understanding of personal preferences, utilizing big data concepts and scalable technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For data ingestion and preprocessing.
- **SparkML**: For implementing the ALS model.
- **ChromaDB**: For embedding-based recommendations.
- **Huggingface**: For generating embeddings using the Mistral model.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization in EDA.

## Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
- `chromadb.ipynb`: Vector database recommendations using Mistral model from Huggingface. Replace the huggingface access token with your own
- `TF_IDF.ipynb`: Recommendations using TF-IDF.
- `Bigdata Project ALS model.ipynb`: Recommendations using the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) method with PySpark.
- `Bigdata Project EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the anime dataset.
- `AnimeVerse.pptx`: Contains the presentation of various approaches, results.
